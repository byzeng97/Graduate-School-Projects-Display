## [Group Pyramid Final Project](https://github.com/byzeng97/Graduate-School-Projects-Display/tree/main/Group%20Pyramid%20Final%20Project)
**Analyzing the effect of youth tobacco consumption on mortality rate**

*Why Important?* 
1. Present Limitation:
   - According to Tobacco twenty-One website, only 31 of the 51 states are “Tobacco 21 state”. 
   - FDA's Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan mainly pays attention to e-cigarette instead of other tobacco.
   - Current policies pays more attention on alcohol instead of tobacco.
2. Preventing tobacco product use among youth is critical to ending the tobacco epidemic in the United States.
3. The project results will support related national youth-limited tobacco policies released by Federal government. 

*Project Aim:*
1. To explore if there is a correlation between youth tobacco consumption and four types of mortality.
2. Mortailities include cancer, heart disease, drug overdose and stroke.
3. Addressing the correlation will have:
   - practical benefits for preventing tobacco use among middle school and high school students .
   - contribute to understanding of the widespread smoking phenomenon among youth.

*Data Description:* 
1. Period: 2014 - 2017; Variables: 12 variables; Rows: 10601 rows
2. Size = 4*12*10601 = 508848
3. [Primary data link](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Survey-Data/Youth-Tobacco-Survey-YTS-Data/4juz-x2tp)

*Tool Selection:*
1. Tableau: exploratory data analysis and visualization. 
2. Python: dataset cleansing, statistical machine learning model building.

*Conclusions & Future Research:*
1. This study would find out how different demographic features would affect the smoking rates.
2. This study would find out the magnitude of different mortality rates correlated with the smoking rates.
3. This study would have one ANOVA model testing the differences of treatment among different smoking groups.
4. This study would open some new ways for researchers to examine more detailed causal effects of youth smoking on mortality.

- [Check out raw dataset here](https://github.com/byzeng97/Graduate-School-Projects-Display/tree/master/Desktop/MSBA%20/Big%20Data%20Analytics/project/Amazon%20fine%20food%20reviews) 

*Background & Purposes
1. Amazon credits recommender systems with 35% of their revenue. They credit recommender systems with a 29% increase in total sales, bringing their yearly sales volume in 2016 up to 135.99 Billion.
2. Build user-based top-10 and item-based top-10 recommendation systems
3. Shopping websites keep showing correct recommended products for a customer

*Data Description*
1. Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
2. Data size: 301 MB (10 columns * 568,454 rows)
3. Data information: 568,454 reviews, 256,059 users, 74,258 products, 260 users with more than 50 reviews

![Methodology Illustation](https://github.com/byzeng97/Graduate-School-Projects-Display/blob/main/Amazon%20fine%20food%20reviews/Methodology%20Illustration.png)

*Expected Results*
1. A ranking list of word to indicate the positive or the negative reviews
2. A chart show some of the most popular product in Amazon fine food
3. Obtain models with different accuracy rates on predicting the positive and negative reviews & refocused on the best model 


## [Student Query Tool](https://github.com/byzeng97/Graduate-School-Projects-Display/blob/main/Student%20Query%20Tool%20.zip)
**A Python mini program to apply queries modified for school administration office demand**

*Goal* 

To build a program using python language (Note: the user interface is via the console):
1. Display all student records.
2. Display students whose last name begins with a certain string (case insensitive).
3. Display all records for students whose graduating year is a certain year.
4. Display a summary report of number and percent of students in each program, for students graduating on/after a certain year.
