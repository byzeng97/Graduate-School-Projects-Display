## [Group Pyramid Final Project](https://github.com/byzeng97/Graduate-School-Projects-Display/tree/main/Group%20Pyramid%20Final%20Project)
**Analyzing the effect of youth tobacco consumption on mortality rate**

*Why Important?* 
1. Present Limitation:
   - According to Tobacco twenty-One website, only 31 of the 51 states are “Tobacco 21 state”. 
   - FDA's Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan mainly pays attention to e-cigarette instead of other tobacco.
   - Current policies pays more attention on alcohol instead of tobacco.
2. Preventing tobacco product use among youth is critical to ending the tobacco epidemic in the United States.
3. The project results will support related national youth-limited tobacco policies released by Federal government. 

*Project Aim:*
1. To explore if there is a correlation between youth tobacco consumption and four types of mortality.
2. Mortailities include cancer, heart disease, drug overdose and stroke.
3. Addressing the correlation will have:
   - practical benefits for preventing tobacco use among middle school and high school students .
   - contribute to understanding of the widespread smoking phenomenon among youth.

*Data Description:* 
1. Period: 2014 - 2017; Variables: 12 variables; Rows: 10601 rows
2. Size = 4*12*10601 = 508848
3. [Primary data link](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Survey-Data/Youth-Tobacco-Survey-YTS-Data/4juz-x2tp)

*Tool Selection:*
1. Tableau: exploratory data analysis and visualization. 
2. Python: dataset cleansing, statistical machine learning model building.

*Conclusions & Future Research:*
1. This study would find out how different demographic features would affect the smoking rates.
2. This study would find out the magnitude of different mortality rates correlated with the smoking rates.
3. This study would have one ANOVA model testing the differences of treatment among different smoking groups.
4. This study would open some new ways for researchers to examine more detailed causal effects of youth smoking on mortality.
