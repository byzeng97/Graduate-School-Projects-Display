Analyzing the effect of youth tobacco consumption on mortality rate

*Why Important?* 

1. Present Limitation:
   - According to Tobacco twenty-One website, only 31 of the 51 states are “Tobacco 21 state”. 
   - FDA's Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan mainly pays attention to e-cigarette instead of other tobacco.
   - Current policies pays more attention on alcohol instead of tobacco.
2. Preventing tobacco product use among youth is critical to ending the tobacco epidemic in the United States.
3. The project results will support related national youth-limited tobacco policies released by Federal government.
